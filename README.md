# Sentinel Guard 🛡️

Sentinel Guard is a middleware-first API firewall and security layer built with Next.js.  
It intercepts incoming requests, enforces security rules, detects attacks, and provides admin-level security insights.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Global API request interception (Edge Middleware)
- Firewall rule engine (IP, method, route)
- IP-based rate limiting
- Attack detection & threat scoring
- Automatic temporary IP blocking
- Security analytics using MongoDB aggregations
- Secure admin authentication (JWT)

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

Client Request  
→ Next.js Middleware (Edge)  
→ Firewall Rules  
→ Rate Limiter  
→ API Route (Node.js)  
→ Logging & Threat Analysis (MongoDB)

Admin access is handled separately using JWT-protected APIs.

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- JavaScript (Node.js runtime)
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- JWT Authentication
- Edge Middleware (Vercel-compatible)

---

## 🔐 Security Design Decisions
- No public admin signup (one-time provisioning)
- Middleware-first request interception
- Separation of public traffic security and admin control plane
- Edge-safe logic for rate limiting and blocking
